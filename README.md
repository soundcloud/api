Please don't post security issues or vulnerabilities here. Instead, submit them to our public [bug-bounty program] to get triaged and receive bounty payouts.

## Frequently asked questions
### Can I request an API key for a new app?
We're actively exploring on how best to open up public access to our API again. While we're currently not issuing new API keys to 3rd party apps, we're helping improve the systems and tools in place to better serve the already active integrations. This is helping us to better understand what resources we need to put in place in order to support this product at scale. We understand this may be frustrating to new developers, but we hope to have your support and patience during this phase. Please subscribe to our [@SoundCloudDev] on Twitter or our [Backstage Blog] for API Announcements

### How can I update my app's `redirect_uri`?
Our Support Team will be happy to help you with your URI's redirects. Please fill out a ticket [here] under "I need help with something else" and they will get back to you as soon as they can.

### My app disappeared from `https://soundcloud.com/you/apps`, what should I do?
If you registered an app with Soundcloud and now cannot find it, it's possible your API keys were revoked as unused for some time.
Our Support Team will be happy to help you with reinstating the keys. Please fill out a ticket [here] under "I need help with something else" and they will get back to you as soon as they can.

### I have a questions about the SDKs. Can I post them here?
Yes, you may. However, please note that we're not maintaining the Ruby, Python or JS SDK anymore and we're going to be announcing soon that we're going to open it for maintainers from the community if there's interest. Our recommendation is to use the API directly and build your own client. We will also be exposing the underlying yaml file for the OpenAPI spec soon, so that folks can generate clients from this. 

### I am an official partner of SoundCloud. Can I use this issue tracker for a technical question?
This repository only deals with the public-facing API. Any partnership-specific questions don’t belong here as this is a public forum; please contact your SoundCloud partnership contact.

## Code of Conduct
Our request to the community - we're a rather small team. You'd be surprised how small we are. We want to help the community but we need to be brutally lean on what we can accomplish. Our mission is to enable a thriving community of innovative projects powered by the SoundCloud platform. In that spirit, we're requesting folks to follow the following guidelines when interacting with our team. 

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:
- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
